            <h1>Meet the human behind this tool</h1>
            <p class="lede">
              After stumbling through relationships both delightful and disastrous—and consulting everyone
              from therapists to patient friends who accidentally became life coaches—this human noticed a
              pattern: values tend to make or break everything. This page is a lighthearted nod to that
              realization, rooted in personal history and backed by solid research.

          <p>
            Over the years, this aspiring relationship analyst found themselves replaying past connections
            like a film critic with too much time on their hands. Some relationships sparkled, some fizzled,
            and some politely excused themselves out the back door. The more they examined the themes, the
            clearer it became: shared values offered ease and depth, while mismatched ones guaranteed a plot
            twist nobody asked for. This insight eventually sparked the creation of this tool.

            Think of this as the digital equivalent of a well-worn notebook filled with observations,
            experiments, and the occasional doodle. It mixes practical insight with curiosity and leaves
            room for humor—because if dating has taught anything, it’s that sometimes things get weird,
            and it helps to laugh.

            The modern view of values in relationships doesn’t belong to one lone genius. It’s a mashup of
            humanistic psychology, values theory, attachment research, evolutionary psychology, social
            exchange theory, and the Gottman Institute’s work on shared meaning. In short: a brainy supergroup
            of ideas that all point to the same message—shared values reduce friction and fuel connection.
          </p>
          <div class="pill-heading">Key frameworks at play</div>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Humanistic psychology (Carl Rogers, Abraham Maslow): authenticity, congruence, self-actualization.</li>
            <li>Values theory (Milton Rokeach; Shalom Schwartz): mapping universal value categories and how they cluster.</li>
            <li>Attachment theory (Bowlby, Ainsworth, Hazan &amp; Shaver): early bonding shapes how we value intimacy and autonomy.</li>
            <li>Evolutionary psychology (Buss, Tooby, Cosmides): values as survival strategies—stability, trust, parenting readiness.</li>
            <li>Social exchange theory (Homans, Thibaut &amp; Kelley): choosing partners who maximize long-term value.</li>
            <li>Gottman research: shared meaning and values alignment predict longevity.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="quote">
            “Using values to choose or understand partners is based on the idea that relationships work best when both people share deeper
            life principles—not just interests or attraction.”
